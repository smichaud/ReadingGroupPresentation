\subsection{Introduction}
\begin{frame}{FAB-MAP 1.0}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Based on bag of words (BoW)
        \item 100\% precision, because false positive break the shit + update appearance model with new sample of known place !
        \item CLT for visual words co-occurence
    \end{enumerate}

    A further salient aspect of the data is that visual words do not occur independently â€“ indeed, word occurrence tends to be highly correlated. For example, words asso-ciated with car wheels and car doors are likely to be observed simultaneously. We capture these dependencies by learning a tree-structured Bayesian network using the ChowLiu algorithm (Chow and Liu 1968),which yields the optimal approximation to the joint distribution over word occurrence within the space of tree-structured networks.
