    \begin{itemize}
        \item Quick note: Let them know that there is differences between FAB-MAP and OpenFABMAP implementation (binary bow, size of descriptors, probabilistic equations...)
        \item There is fabmap binaries available
        \item Codebook and CLT generation
        \item Can change keypoints detector and descriptors (STAR best for them)
        \item Does not have implementations 2.0
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{OpenFABMAP}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Tested on 10 dataset (single cam, omnidirectional)
        \item At best reported 16\% recall for 100\% precision (show figure)
        \item Show little demo with my dataset
    \end{itemize}
