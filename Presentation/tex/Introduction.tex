    This paper describes a probabilistic approach to the problem of recog- nizing places based on their appearance. The system we present is not limited to localization, but can determine that a new observa- tion comes from a previously unseen place, and so augment its map. Effectively this is a SLAM system in the space of appearance.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Place recognition
        \item based on images
        \item map large outdoor environmenent(60+km)
